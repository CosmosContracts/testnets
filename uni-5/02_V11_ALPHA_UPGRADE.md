# Uni v11 Alpha Upgrade

You will want to update IAVL config in `.juno/config/app.toml`. This should go in the base configuration section, e.g. under `index-events`:

```toml
# IavlCacheSize set the size of the iavl tree cache.
# Default cache size is 50mb.
iavl-cache-size = 781250

# IAVLDisableFastNode enables or disables the fast node feature of IAVL.
# Default is true.
iavl-disable-fastnode = false
```

Note - what you may have seen on other networks is the IAVL config setting `iavl-disable-fastnode` to true. We are going to see how long the migration takes on Uni to establish a ballpark time for mainnet.
