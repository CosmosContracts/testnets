# Junø - uni-1-resurrection Testnet

This testnet will start at the patched version of juno (`v2.1.0`). You will need to use the distributed binary from the juno packages repository.

It is important to note that as we are simply restarting `uni-1` that the testnet name will not change.

## If you are reusing a testnet box, do this first

1. Stop your node
2. Reset `junod unsafe-reset-all`
3. Remove genesis `rm .juno/config/genesis.json`
4. Remove gentxs `rm -r .juno/config/gentx/`
5. Ensure wasm dir is removed: `rm -r .juno/data/wasm` (should have been removed by unsafe-reset anyway)
6. If you are using cosmovisor, remove symlink: `rm .juno/cosmovisor/current`
7. Remove & recreate upgrades dir: `rm -r .juno/cosmovisor/upgrades/ && mkdir -p .juno/cosmovisor/upgrades`
8. Check genesis bin is `v2.1.0`: `$DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/genesis/bin/junod version`
9. Remove `seeds` and `persistent_peers` entries in `config.toml` - people will post their peer on discord before genesis
10. Download the genesis from this folder as instructed below

Once you have deleted the old stuff, your cosmovisor should look like:

```
.juno/cosmovisor/
├── genesis
│   └── bin
│       └── junod
└── upgrades
```

**Genesis File**

[Genesis File](/uni-1-resurrection/genesis.json):

```bash
   curl -s  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CosmosContracts/testnets/main/uni-1-resurrection/genesis.json > ~/.juno/config/genesis.json
```

**Genesis sha256**

```bash
sha256sum ~/.juno/config/genesis.json
# b9ddd6566e6fa1a01a249c09ff42d73bbdf975da8528e861cbbbb4f32e3a81d3
```

**junod version**

```bash
$DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/genesis/bin/junod version version --long
name: juno
server_name: junod
version: v2.1.0
commit: e6b8c212b178cf575035065b78309aed547b1335
build_tags: netgo muslc, # THIS BIT IS KEY
```

**Seed nodes**

```

```

**Persistent Peers**

```
TBC
```

#### Download and verify:

Note, if you're reusing a box from `uni` you likely already have the correct binary. If you're using cosmovisor, you can simply follow the steps at the top of this page.

You only need to do these steps if for some reason you need to repopulate your genesis binary, e.g. if you are not using cosmovisor.

```sh
# find out where junod is - will likely be /home/<your-user>/go/bin/junod
which junod

# put new binary there i.e. in path/to/juno
wget https://github.com/CosmosContracts/juno/releases/download/v2.1.0/junod -O $(which junod)

# if you run this, you should see build_tags: netgo muslc,
# if there is a permissions problem use chmod/chown to make sure it is executable
junod version --long

# confirm it is using the static lib - should return "not a dynamic executable"
ldd $(which junod)

# if you really want to be sure
# this should return:
# ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, 
# Go BuildID=4Ec3fj_EKdvh_u8K3RGJ/JIKOgYFXTJ9LzGROhs8n/uC9gpeaM9MaYurh9DJiN/YcvB8Jc2ivQM2zUSHMhg, stripped
file $(which junod)
```

Check that you have the right Juno version installed:

```sh
$ junod version --long
name: juno
server_name: junod
version: v2.1.0
commit: e6b8c212b178cf575035065b78309aed547b1335
build_tags: netgo muslc, # THE MUSLC TAG IS KEY
```

### Minimum hardware requirements

- 8-16GB RAM
- 100GB of disk space
- 2 cores

## Gentxs

We will be restarting using a modified genesis file from `uni-1`; only validators from that genesis set can join at genesis, others should join later. _This means that no gentxs are needed_.

#### Running in production

**Note, we'll be going through some upgrades for this testnet. Consider using [Cosmovisor](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/master/cosmovisor) to make your life easier.** Setting up Cosmovisor is covered in the [Juno Documentation](https://docs.junochain.com/validators/setting-up-cosmovisor).

Download Genesis file when the time is right. Put it in your `/home/<user>/.juno` folder.

If you have not installed cosmovisor, create a systemd file for your Juno service:

```sh
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/junod.service
```

Copy and paste the following and update `<YOUR_USERNAME>` and `<CHAIN_ID>`:

```sh
Description=Juno daemon
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=juno
ExecStart=/home/<YOUR_USERNAME>/go/bin/junod start
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=4096

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start the new service:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable junod
sudo systemctl start junod
```

Check status:

```sh
junod status
```

Check logs:

```sh
journalctl -u junod -f
```
